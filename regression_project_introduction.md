# REGRESSION
Course Project Introduction
### Summary
Using data scraped from a website, build a linear regression model that addresses a useful prediction and/or interpretation problem in any domain of interest such as movies or sports. Communicate your process and findings in a 5-minute presentation and a short written description. Please refer to the Home page for deadline information.

### Components
Metis projects are broken down into 5 component parts – design, data, algorithms, tools, and communication – that correspond to the project success guide. Below is a description of each component as it relates to this project. For more detail on how these components are graded and how extra points are rewarded, refer to the rubric (project success guide).

#### Design
* The project should be centered around a well-posed regression problem in a domain of interest that can be reasonably addressed by available data.
* All deliverable deadlines should be met, reflecting professionalism and effective scoping and workflow.
#### Data
* The primary data must be acquired through web scraping.
* Supplemental data obtained through other means is always welcome, but not required.
* Make sure that you have a continuous, numerical target variable to predict (e.g. revenue, price, # views, salary, etc.). Aim to have 1000+ data points and 10+ features so that you can build a robust model with interesting feature engineering and selection challenges; consult with an instructor if you are considering deviating from this rule of thumb, which is often fine.
* Data from any publicly accessible, scrapeable source is fine, but recommended sources that are known to be scrapeable include:
    movie: [boxofficemojo.com](http://boxofficemojo.com/), [imdb.com](http://imdb.com/)
    sports: [sports-reference.com](http://sports-reference.com/)
#### Algorithms
* Building a linear regression in Python is required, including the appropriate use of techniques such as regularization and/or polynomial features and other feature engineering, as appropriate.
* Rigorous model selection and evaluation (i.e. proper validation and testing) is required.
* Other regression methods (beyond those covered in the course) are optional.
#### Tools
* Web scraping tools (one or more of BeautifulSoup, Selenium, or another Python scraping tool) are required for data acquisition.
* Other tools not covered in the course are optional but welcome.
#### Communication
* Students will deliver a 5-minute slide presentation at the end of the module. These should be given in a compelling, clear manner and include effective visuals for communicating your objectives and findings.
* You will also submit a ~1 page written description summarizing your work: it should begin with a ~100 word abstract to be followed by a breakdown of your project along with the 5 major components.
